**Welcome to project *DevOS EcoSystem*!**

DevOS is an ambitious initiative to create a series of Arch Linux-based operating systems tailored for different platforms, all while sharing a common core and a unified package manager, DevPKG.

**This repository currently focuses on Dev-Top OS, the Desktop/Laptop edition of DevOS.**

## Project Goals
The overarching goals of the DevOS project are:
* **Consistency:** Provide a familiar Arch Linux experience across various devices through a shared core and package manager.
* **Customization:** Offer a highly customizable base that users can adapt to their specific needs on each platform.
* **Innovation:** Explore platform-specific optimizations and unique features to enhance the user experience.
* **Community Driven:** Foster an open and collaborative environment for development and growth.

## DevOS Editions (Planned)
While this repository currently focuses on the Desktop/Laptop edition, the DevOS vision includes:
* **Dev-Top OS [Desktop/Laptop Edition]:** A stable and customizable Arch-based OS for desktop and laptop computers. (**Under Production**)
  * **Dev-TopGM [Gaming Edition of Dev-Top OS]:** A performance-optimized version of Dev-Top OS tailored for PC gaming. (**Future Development**)
  * **Dev-TopSec [Cybersecurity Edition of Dev-Top OS]:** A hardened version of Dev-Top OS with pre-installed security tools for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. (**Under Production**)
* **Dev-Droid OS [Smart Phone Edition]:** An Arch-based OS optimized for mobile devices with a touch-centric user interface. (**Future Development**)
* **Dev-Car OS [Car Edition]:** An Arch-based system designed for smart cars and Android-powered in-car systems, focusing on integration and stability. (**Future Development**)
* **Dev-Watch OS [Smartwatch Edition]:** A lightweight and power-efficient Arch-based OS for smartwatches with a focus on sensor integration and connectivity. (**Future Development**)

## About the Creator
Project *DevOS EcoSystem* is being initiated and led by **Srijan Bhattacharyya**, a passionate software engineer with a strong affinity for *Arch Linux* and a vision for a more integrated and consistent personal computing experience across different devices/platforms with a background in software development and a keen interest in *Operating Systems*. He aims to build a community around this project and collaboratively bring different sectors of **DevOS EcoSystem** to life.

## Dev-Top OS (Current Focus)
Dev-Top OS aims to provide a flexible and powerful desktop experience built on the solid foundation of _Arch Linux_ and _i3wm_. It will offer:
* A clean base installation allowing users to choose their preferred desktop environment or window manager (Default _i3wm_).
* Integration with the _DevPKG_ package manager (under development).
* Focus on stability and performance for everyday computing and development tasks.

## DevPKG - The Unified Package Manager (Work in Progress)
**DevPKG** is envisioned as the central package management tool for all DevOS editions, providing a consistent way to install, update, and manage software across different platforms. Currently, this project is in its early stages.

## Getting Involved
DevOS is an open-source project, and contributions of all kinds are highly appreciated! Here's how you can get involved:

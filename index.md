**Welcome to the DevOS project!**

DevOS is an ambitious initiative to create a series of Arch Linux-based operating systems tailored for different platforms, all while sharing a common core and a unified package manager, DevPKG.

**This repository currently focuses on Dev-Top OS, the Desktop/Laptop edition of DevOS.**

## Project Goals

The overarching goals of the DevOS project are:

* **Consistency:** Provide a familiar Arch Linux experience across various devices through a shared core and package manager.
* **Customization:** Offer a highly customizable base that users can adapt to their specific needs on each platform.
* **Innovation:** Explore platform-specific optimizations and unique features to enhance the user experience.
* **Community Driven:** Foster an open and collaborative environment for development and growth.

## DevOS Editions (Planned)

While this repository currently focuses on the Desktop/Laptop edition, the DevOS vision includes:

* **Dev-Top OS [Desktop/Laptop Edition]:** A stable and customizable Arch-based OS for desktop and laptop computers. (**Under Production**)
  * **Dev-TopGM [Gaming Edition of Dev-Top OS]:** A performance-optimized version of Dev-Top OS tailored for PC gaming. (**Future Development**)
  * **Dev-TopSec [Cybersecurity Edition of Dev-Top OS]:** A hardened version of Dev-Top OS with pre-installed security tools for cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts. (**Under Production**)
* **Dev-Droid OS [Smart Phone Edition]:** An Arch-based OS optimized for mobile devices with a touch-centric user interface. (**Future Development**)
* **Dev-Car OS [Car Edition]:** An Arch-based system designed for smart cars and Android-powered in-car systems, focusing on integration and stability. (**Future Development**)
* **Dev-Watch OS [Smartwatch Edition]:** A lightweight and power-efficient Arch-based OS for smartwatches with a focus on sensor integration and connectivity. (**Future Development**)

## About the Creator

DevOS is being initiated and led by a passionate software engineer with a strong affinity for Arch Linux and a vision for a more integrated and consistent personal computing experience across devices. With a background in software development and a keen interest in operating system customization, the creator aims to build a community around this project and collaboratively bring the DevOS vision to life.

## Dev-Top OS - Current Focus

Dev-Top OS aims to provide a flexible and powerful desktop experience built on the solid foundation of Arch Linux. It will offer:

* A clean base installation allowing users to choose their preferred desktop environment or window manager (with potential optimized defaults).
* Integration with the DevPKG package manager (under development).
* Focus on stability and performance for everyday computing and development tasks.

## DevPKG - The Unified Package Manager (Work in Progress)

DevPKG is envisioned as the central package management tool for all DevOS editions, providing a consistent way to install, update, and manage software across different platforms. Currently, this project is in its early stages. We are exploring the best approach, which may involve:

* Forking and adapting an existing Arch Linux package manager helper (like `yay`).
* Developing a custom package manager with cross-platform considerations in mind.

**Contributions and discussions regarding the architecture and development of DevPKG are highly welcome!**

## Getting Involved

DevOS is an open-source project, and contributions of all kinds are highly appreciated! Here's how you can get involved:

* **Testing:** Once we have initial ISOs or build scripts, testing on various hardware and providing feedback will be invaluable.
* **Development:** If you have experience with Linux system administration, kernel configuration, package management, or cross-platform development, we'd love your help!
* **Documentation:** Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential. Help us write guides, tutorials, and API references.
* **Community Support:** Help others by answering questions and sharing your knowledge.
* **Ideas and Suggestions:** Share your thoughts on how DevOS can be improved and what features you'd like to see.

## Contributing Guidelines

We will be establishing detailed contribution guidelines soon. In the meantime, please feel free to:

* Fork this repository and experiment.
* Submit pull requests with bug fixes or improvements.
* Open issues to report bugs or suggest features.
* Engage in discussions and share your ideas.
